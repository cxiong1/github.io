    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "League of Legends is a MOBA (Massive Online Battle Arena) type game. It is a competitive game in which two teams of 10 players (5v5) battle it out. Each player selects their own unique champion and they have to work together with their team to battle against the enemy. There is not only a lot of skill involved, but also strategy as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The premise of the game is simple. Players are placed into a map called summoners rift. Each player's respective champion can gain level by beating the game's monsters. By defeating the game control mobs, called creeps, their champions gain experience and gold. Experience allows the champion to level up and gold lets the champion purchase items from the shop. Levels and items will increase a champion stats such as health, attack damage, etc. The end object is to become more powerful than the opposing team's champions and to evantually defeat them by attacking their base, also called a Nexus in game. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my tutorial, I will go over some basic mechanics and patterns that have developed over the course of the game. I will be analyzing the win rates of certain champions compared to others and dissecting this reasoning. The game has developed a META, which means the game within the game. A more direct way of explaining it is \"Most Effective Tactic Available.\" This means that a majority of the players will follow these specific set of guidelines because they yield the most results, in this case, wins for the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is set up as a 5v5 game but each of the players in the 5 man group all play a different way. Usually each player plays a unique lane or role in this case. The most widely accepted roles are Top, Jungle, Mid, Bot, and Support. For my tutorial I will be analyzing the Bot role and their respective dynamics. "
